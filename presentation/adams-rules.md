Testable Objects
================

Adam’s Rules
------------

* If you don’t know where to start with testing an object, you build it wrong.
* If your object has more than 15-20 tests, you object is probably doing to much. Break it up
* If you have more than 15-20 lines of code bootstrapping your test, your object is too complicated
* If you have to modify more that a few tests for a single method modification, your object is too complicated

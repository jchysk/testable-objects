Testable Objects
================

Large code bases require testing to prevent side-effects when code is added or updated. When creating tests
for objects it is important that the tests are effective and maintainable. Poorly written tests are not much
better than no tests at all. Bad tests give false positives and negatives. They can require more coding than
the actual code change being made. Bad tests may also create the sense that tests are more trouble than they
are worth. This defeats the whole pupoes of testing in the first place.

Why Testable Objects?
---------------------

Good tests require good objects to be effective and maintainable. Objects that are poor require make it nearly
impossible to write good tests. Often time, the worst code bases do not allow for unit testing at all. Many developers
can remember a code base they created or inherited that was untestable. Bugs were constantly introduced due to
overly complex objects creating unintended side effects when the simplest change was made. Using proper
Object Oriented techniques can make your code more testable and therefore more reliable and more maintainable.

Testable Objects
================

Why Focus On Objects not Tests?
-------------------------------

Large code bases require testing to prevent side-effects when code is added or updated

Poorly written tests are not much better than no tests at all

* They give false positives and negatives
* They can require more coding than the actual code change being made
* They create the sense that tests are more trouble than they are worth
